# Nginx Deployment

## Create a Droplet

- Create a new droplet with ubuntu latest version

## [Create a Non Admin user](Safeuser.md)

## Installing Nginx

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

## Adjust Firewall

- Before testing Nginx, the firewall software needs to be adjusted to allow access to the service.
- Nginx registers itself as a service with ufw upon installation, making it straightforward to allow Nginx access.
- List the application configurations that `ufw` knows how to work with by typing:

```shell
sudo ufw app list
```

It should show `Nginx Full`, `Nginx HTTP` & `Nginx HTTPS`.

As demonstrated by the output, there are three profiles available for Nginx:

- `Nginx Full`: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
- `Nginx HTTP`: This profile opens only port 80
- `Nginx HTTPS`: This profile opens only port 443

- Now, enable profile:

```shell
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

- Verify Status

```shell
sudo ufw status
```

## Managing Nginx

- Stop Nginx

```shell
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

- Start Nginx

```shell
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

- Restart Nginx

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- Reload configuration changes without dropping connections

```shell
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

- Test your Nginx Configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

```shell
sudo nginx -t
```

### Avoid Nginx Hash bucket problem

```shell
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Uncomment the `server_names_hash_bucket_size` directive

```conf
...
http {
    ...
    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
    ...
}
...
```

- Save & close the file
- Check the configuration

```shell
sudo nginx -t
```

- If all ok, restart Nginx to enable your changes

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
