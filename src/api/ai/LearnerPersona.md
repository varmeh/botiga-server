# Learner Persona Classification

## Learning Styles

There are 2 primary learning styles:

-   **Theoretical Learning**
    -   These learners prefer a more conceptual and in-depth understanding of a subject before diving into hands-on activities
    -   They appreciate analogies, explanations, and examples that connect programming concepts to real-life situations
-   **Practical (Application-based) Learning**
    -   These learners prefer to learn by doing and focus on hands-on activities and real-world applications
    -   They find it more engaging to explore concepts by implementing them in actual projects

### Learning Methods

Theoretical and Practical Learning Styles use the following learning methods and techniques within each approach

#### Theoretical Learning Style

1. _Lectures and Presentations_: Traditional classroom-style teaching where an instructor delivers information about concepts and principles to learners.

2. _Reading and Research_: Learners read textbooks, articles, or online resources to deepen their understanding of the subject matter.

3. _Concept Mapping_: Visual representation of key concepts, their relationships, and hierarchical structure, which helps learners to organize their understanding.

4. _Case Studies_: In-depth analysis of real-world examples to explore the application of theoretical concepts in various scenarios.

5. _Group Discussions_: Learners engage in discussions to share their understanding, ask questions, and clarify doubts, fostering a deeper comprehension of the subject matter.

6. _Peer Instruction_: Learners take turns teaching each other, explaining concepts in their own words, and receiving feedback from their peers.

#### Practical Learning Style

1. _Project-Based Learning_: Learners work on real-world projects, applying their knowledge to solve problems and create solutions.

2. _Coding Exercises and Challenges_: Learners complete coding tasks, either individually or in groups, to practice their skills and reinforce their understanding of concepts.

3. _Workshops and Labs_: Structured hands-on sessions where learners practice skills, work on tasks, and receive guidance and feedback from instructors.

4. _Pair Programming_: Two learners work together on a coding task, with one typing the code and the other reviewing and providing feedback.

5. _Code Review_: Learners review each other's code, offering constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

6. _Problem-Based Learning_: Learners are presented with a problem to solve, encouraging them to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical context.

By incorporating a mix of these low-level learning methods and techniques within the theoretical and practical approaches, we can create a more varied and engaging learning experience that caters to a wide range of learning preferences.
Remember to adjust the balance and emphasis on different methods based on the needs of our learners

## Categorizing Learners

1. **Analytical Thinker** (ANT):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Theoretical Learning
-   These individuals enjoy understanding the underlying principles and concepts before applying them. They appreciate logical explanations, structured information, and may prefer lectures, reading, and research.

2. **Practical Problem Solver** (PPS):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Practical Learning
-   Practical problem solvers prefer hands-on activities and learning by doing. They enjoy tackling real-world problems and applying their skills directly. They may prefer project-based learning, coding exercises, and workshops.

3. **Creative Innovator** (CRI):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Blended Learning (Theoretical + Practical)
-   Creative individuals often benefit from a mix of theoretical understanding and practical application, which allows them to experiment with new ideas and approaches. They may enjoy brainstorming sessions, group discussions, and opportunities for creative expression within their projects.

4. **Social Learner** (SAL):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Collaborative Learning
-   Social learners thrive in group settings and enjoy learning from and with others. They may prefer group discussions, peer instruction, pair programming, or team projects.

5. **Reflective Learner** (RTL):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Self-Directed Learning
-   Reflective learners prefer to process information at their own pace and often benefit from independent study. They may prefer reading, research, and opportunities to reflect on their learning through journaling or self-assessment.

6. **Detail-Oriented Learner** (DOL):

-   _Preferred Learning Style_: Structured Learning
-   Detail-oriented learners appreciate clear instructions, step-by-step guides, and a well-defined learning path. They may prefer demonstrations, tutorials, and methodical approaches to learning new concepts.

Remember that individuals may exhibit characteristics from multiple personas and have preferences for more than one learning style.
The best approach to teaching is to use a combination of methods and materials that cater to a variety of learning styles, allowing each learner to engage with the material in a way that suits their individual preferences.
